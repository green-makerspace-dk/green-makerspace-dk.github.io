# Gallery Folder

This folder contains images for the Green Makerspace gallery.

## Supported Image Formats
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- WebP
- BMP

## How to Add Images
1. Place image files directly in this folder
2. The gallery page will automatically detect and display them
3. Image filenames will be used as titles (with underscores/hyphens converted to spaces)

## Image Guidelines
- **Recommended size**: 1200x800 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- **File size**: Keep under 2MB for optimal loading
- **Naming**: Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `workshop-session-2024.jpg`)

## Current Images
Currently using sample images from the main images folder for demonstration.
Replace with actual gallery images as they become available.
